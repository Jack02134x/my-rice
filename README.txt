Instructions
Edit the hyprlock file to suit your preferences.

Review all file paths in the .scripts folder — many scripts reference specific locations, so correct paths are essential.

Important: Move the .scripts folder to your home directory (~) — otherwise, several scripts will break, and you’ll need to manually update all path references in the hypr configuration folder.

Every time you want to change your wallpaper and apply the Matugen theme, run the following command:

~/.scripts/msms.sh "/path/to/your/wallpaper"
